🎯 Delaunay Triangulation in C

This repository contains a basic yet functional implementation of Delaunay Triangulation in C. Built in just two days as part of a coursework project, it serves as a starting point for understanding and implementing the algorithm.

🚀 While this version is unoptimized, feel free to modify, improve, and build upon it!
🔹 What is Delaunay Triangulation?

Delaunay Triangulation is a method of dividing a set of points into non-overlapping triangles such that no point lies inside the circumcircle of any triangle. This technique is widely used in:
✔ Computational geometry
✔ Mesh generation
✔ Terrain modeling
✔ Computer graphics
🖥 Output Examples
🔹 6 Nodes → 6 Triangles
