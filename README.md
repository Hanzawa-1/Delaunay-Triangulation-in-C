# Delaunay-Triangulation-in-C
This is a very basic, crude, unoptimized implementation of Delaunay's triangulation in C language. It's a result of a course work done in 2 days, so it's not perfect.  This can be used to get idea how to implement. You are free to do changes and add optimizations to it. Below are two triangulations obtained by the implementation.
